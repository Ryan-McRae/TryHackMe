Okay great so now i have a vm running a kali virtual machine. I am using openvpn on my host machine to connect to the THM network.

Okay so first thing first, the target IP: 10.82.132.22

I believe this address may change as it isnt the same as last time. But for now we have the IP of interest.

Next we run “nmap” on the target IP:

```jsx
└─$ nmap 10.82.132.22
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-11-28 14:21 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.82.132.22
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.97 seconds
```

So this shows us some interesting points. Firstly 998 closed TCP ports. This is fine, more importantly it shows us that port 22 and 80 are open. This is the ssh and http service ports. This is good because we have two potential attack surfaces. Mainly focusing on the HTTP port. Not to mention the THM descriptor did mention web vulnerabilities, so we are most likely on web side of things.

What we are going to down now is run nmap but with flags. Firstly a flag for version detection and then another flag that runs a default NSE whihc may provide more information.

```jsx
└─$ nmap -sC -sV 10.82.132.22
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-11-28 14:31 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.82.132.22
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)

22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.9 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.54 seconds
```

So here we do get some useful info. We notice that the webserver redirects us to a “lookup.thm” indicating that we cannot access this via a normal dns lookup. So now adjust our vm host file to essentially tell it to use this IP when looking up “lookup.thm”.
